# A1-
- Should have been initializing students and student list within iVoteService class instead of in Driver class (recieving lots of NullPointerErrors because I didn't do that)
- Did not include randomized ID numbers like I intended to (ran out of time) 
- Originally tried initialize MultipleChoice with only an integer after which through keyboard input the user could specify the possible answers which would correspond to each index within the MultipleChoice answers list, then quit and redid MultipleChoice initialization
- Ignore the answer class
- Also meant to write interfaces as generic, insert "I ran out of time" excuse
